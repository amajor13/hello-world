# Python Programming Guide

## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

### Key Features of Python

- **Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is clean and intuitive
- **Interpreted Language**: No need for compilation
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports object-oriented programming paradigms
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more
- **Extensive Libraries**: Rich ecosystem of third-party packages
- **Community Support**: Large and active developer community

## Python Basics

### Variables and Data Types

Python supports various data types:

```python
# Numbers
integer_var = 42
float_var = 3.14
complex_var = 1 + 2j

# Strings
text = "Hello, World!"
multiline_text = """This is a
multiline string"""

# Boolean
is_true = True
is_false = False

# Lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

# Dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Tuples
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Control Flow

#### Conditional Statements

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")
```

#### Loops

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### Functions

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    """Function to greet a person"""
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

# Function call
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)

# Lambda function
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))
```

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.mileage = 0
    
    def drive(self, miles):
        self.mileage += miles
        print(f"Drove {miles} miles. Total mileage: {self.mileage}")
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"

# Create an object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
print(my_car)
my_car.drive(100)
```

### Inheritance

```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, battery_capacity):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity
        self.charge_level = 100
    
    def charge(self, hours):
        # Simplified charging logic
        charge_added = hours * 10
        self.charge_level = min(100, self.charge_level + charge_added)
        print(f"Charged for {hours} hours. Battery level: {self.charge_level}%")

tesla = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model 3", 2021, 75)
tesla.charge(2)
```

## File Handling

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!\n")
    file.write("This is file handling example.")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Reading line by line
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

## Error Handling

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("This always executes")
```

## Best Practices

### Code Style

1. **Follow PEP 8**: Python's official style guide
2. **Use meaningful variable names**: `user_count` instead of `uc`
3. **Write docstrings**: Document your functions and classes
4. **Keep functions small**: One function, one responsibility
5. **Use type hints**: Help with code readability and debugging

```python
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a rectangle.
    
    Args:
        length: The length of the rectangle
        width: The width of the rectangle
    
    Returns:
        The area of the rectangle
    """
    return length * width
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Use list comprehensions**: More efficient than loops
2. **Choose appropriate data structures**: Sets for membership testing, dictionaries for lookups
3. **Use generators**: Memory-efficient for large datasets
4. **Profile your code**: Use tools like `cProfile` to identify bottlenecks

### Security Considerations

1. **Validate input**: Never trust user input
2. **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection
3. **Handle sensitive data carefully**: Use environment variables for secrets
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update packages for security fixes
